# Third-Person-Camera-Unity-Demo
This project was made to show the fundamentals of building a Third-Person Camera System in Unity. The goal was to create a camera that follows the player from behind while maintaining smooth movement, proper positioning, and basic collision handling.

Apply SC_TPSController to "Player" and SC_CameraCollision to "Main Camera"
